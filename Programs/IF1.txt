!* Simple program showing that slicing works with control statements notice that
   slicing on "aa" will give back the program because both aa and bb are
   required for the if statement. Also notice that the bb - 10 statement is
   always sliced away because it affects nothing
*!

let aa = 0;
let bb = 100;
if (aa < bb) {
    bb - 10;
    let aa = ~aa;
} else {
  let aa = 1000;
};
