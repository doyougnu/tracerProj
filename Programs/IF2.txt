!* This program is a stress test, to see a normal slice, slice on "aa". To see
   my program break down slice on "bb". Basically nested control flow statements
   are not reconstructed correctly and so the entire if-statement will be lost.
   I'm convinced there must be a cleaner way to reconstruct ASTs then the graph
   crawling done in this project
*!
let aa = 0;
let bb = __;
while (aa < 101){
      if (aa / 5 == 0){
        let bb = _Fizz_;
      } else {
        let bb = _Buzz_;
      };

      let aa = aa + 1;
};
bb;
